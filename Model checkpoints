Model checkpoints
 Avoid Uploading Large Files Directly to GitHub
GitHub has a file upload limit of 100 MB per file. If your .pth file is larger:

Option A: Use GitHub Releases (Best)
Go to your GitHub repo.

Click on "Releases" > "Draft a new release".

Attach your model files there.

Add a tag and description.
 Model Checkpoints
Provide links to pre-trained model checkpoints (if available) or instructions on how to save and load trained models. This allows users to quickly test the model without having to train from scratch.

To load a pre-trained model:
